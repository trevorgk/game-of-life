game-of-life
============

A working version of Conway's 'Game of Life'. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life 

I implemented it using a checkbox grid, which has some rudimentary styling tricks applied in order to make it feel less like a bunch of checkboxes. The script game.js contains the module which initialises the markup and wires up the event handlers.
